    ``ExtensionsConfig.resolve_config_path()`` raises ``FileNotFoundError``
    when an explicit `config_path` or `DEER_FLOW_EXTENSIONS_CONFIG_PATH`
    points at a file that does not exist. That is deliberate for callers that
    load the config for actual use (e.g. ``ExtensionsConfig.from_file()`` via
    ``get_mcp_tools()``): an operator-asserted explicit path going missing is
    a real misconfiguration and must be surfaced loudly.

    This helper is not one of those callers — it only backs the cache's own
    staleness check (``_is_cache_stale``, via ``_current_config_state``),
    which runs on every ``get_cached_mcp_tools()`` call and just wants to know
    whether the previously loaded config is still current. If the file behind
    a previously-valid explicit/env-var path becomes unreadable later
    (deleted mid-run, a Docker mount hiccup, ...), raising here would crash
    every subsequent call to that hot per-request path instead of leaving the
    cache serving its last-known-good MCP tools. So this wrapper catches that
    specific failure and treats it the same as "unconfigured", matching
    ``_is_cache_stale()``'s existing fail-soft handling of a ``None`` config
    state (see its docstring). Scoping the catch here — rather than making
    ``resolve_config_path()`` itself return ``None`` for every caller — keeps
    the loud failure intact for callers that actually need the file.
